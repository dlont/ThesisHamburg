Trigger-level event selection cannot fulfil signal to background discrimination requirements necessary for precision analysis because of limited processing time and significant complexity of the reconstruction algorithms for the objects such as secondary vertices, particle decays or jets. In addition, information about detector operating conditions such as the number of dead channels, changes in high voltage, CTD gas pressure, temperature, etc. are difficult or impossible to take into account at the trigger level. Therefore, in addition to data-quality and trigger requirements, an offline event selection which were applied to the data are described in this chapter.
