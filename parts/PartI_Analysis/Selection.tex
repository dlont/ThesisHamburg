In order to define the phase space of the measurement, ensure low fraction of background contamination and reasonable description of detector acceptance by MC simulations, selection cuts were applied to the data and MC events. In this chapter data-quality as well as (on-)off-line event selection criteria are described. The chapter starts with a discussion of characteristic features of signal events. Then background sources are elucidated. The chapter proceeds with the discussion of run selection, data-quality requirements and the list of online and offline selection cuts. It finishes with the description of the final event sample and comparison of data and MC distributions for selected events.
