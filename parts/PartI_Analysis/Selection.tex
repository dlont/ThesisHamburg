In order to define the phase space of the measurement, ensure low fraction of background contamination and reasonable understanding of detector acceptance, selection cuts were applied to the data and MC events. In this chapter data-quality and trigger requirements as well as (on-)off-line event selection criteria are described. The chapter starts with a discussion of characteristic features of signal events. Then background sources are elucidated. The chapter proceeds with the discussion of run selection and data-quality requirements and finishes with listing online and offline selection cuts.
