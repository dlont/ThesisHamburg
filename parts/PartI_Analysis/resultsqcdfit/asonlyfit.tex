The results of QCD fits are presented in the following. The outcome from different fit variants is described in detail along with the discussion of the stability of the fits with respect to different assumptions imposed in the \asz extraction procedure. Also the dependence of the results on the choice of the data used in the fit is emphasised.

The presentation starts with the simplest variant of the fit in which the strong coupling \asz is determined from the measured inclusive-jet cross sections using proton PDFs extracted in the global fits as external parameters.
