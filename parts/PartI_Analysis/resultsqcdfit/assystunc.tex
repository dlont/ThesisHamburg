The influence of systematic uncertainties on the extracted \asz value was investigated and is summarised in Table~\ref{tab:asuncbreakdown}.

\caption{Contribution of different sources of experimental uncertainty to the total experimental uncertainty on \asz determined from the fit to double-differential cross sections. The considered sources of experimental error on \asz-value are statistical, combined uncorrelated systematic uncertainty, jet-energy scale and luminosity uncertainties. The second column contains the breakdown of uncertainty contributions attributed to different sources and treated as described in Section~\ref{subsec:sysunctreatment}. The last column presents the contribution of correlated errors source, when treated as uncorrelated.}
\label{tab:asuncbreakdown}
\end{table}

The dominant contribution to the total experimental uncertainty on \as arises from the absolute jet-energy scale and luminosity errors on the jet cross sections and amounts to about 1\%. The other contributions due to limited statistics and due to uncorrelated sources of systematic uncertainties are smaller. 

For comparison the last column in Table~\ref{tab:asuncbreakdown} illustrates the effect of treating jet-energy scale and luminosity errors as uncorrelated. It can be seen that, although such an approach can be inconsistent, it results in an optimistic estimate of experimental uncertainties. Furthermore, uncorrelated treatment of these sources of uncertainty yields different \as values and gives rise to larger values of $\chi^2/N_\text{DF}$.
