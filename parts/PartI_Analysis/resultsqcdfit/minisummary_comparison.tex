This result is in good agreement with previous similar analyses~\cite{HERAIjets} and more recent extractions at HERA~\cite{britzger}. When compared to \hera I results~\cite{}, this determination features increased statistical precision, especially in the high-\etjetb and high-\qsq region. However, the main limitation of the precision on \asz is due to the unknown contribution of the truncated terms of the perturbative series and therefore higher-order predictions are necessary in order to profit from the high experimental precision of the data.
