In the QCD fit the predictions $\mathbf{t}\left( \mathbf{a},\asz\right)$ are usually treated as functions of the proton PDF parameters, $\mathbf{a}$, and the strong coupling constant \asz. In the kinematic phase space of \hera not all parton species contribute to the hadronic final-state. These are the gluon ($g$), and five quark flavours: up ($u$), down ($d$), strange ($s$), charm ($c$), bottom ($b$) and corresponding anti-quarks; because of large mass of the (anti-)top quark its contribution can be neglected. The PDFs are functions of the parton momentum fraction $x$. In principle, their shape is a calculable quantity in QCD. However, due to non-perturbative nature of the PDFs, the predictions for limited number of first moments 
\begin{equation}
 M_n=\int\mathrm{d}x\,x^n f\left(x\right), \qquad (n\ge1)
\end{equation}
are available at the moment~\cite{Hagler:2009ni}, and the most precise extraction of the proton PDFs is achieved in QCD analysis of experimental data. In the extraction procedures some assumptions concerning the shape of the distributions have to be made. In the HERAPDF approach~\cite{Aaron:2009aa} the generic functional form of the parton distribution functions at the input scale is chosen to be:
\begin{equation}
 xf\left(x\right) = A_ix^{B_i}\left(1-x\right)^{C_i}\left(1+\epsilon_i\sqrt{x}+D_ix+E_ix^2\right).
 \label{eq:pdfansatz}
\end{equation}
In general, variables sets $\left(A_i,B_i,C_i,D_i,E_i,\epsilon_i\right)\subset\mathbf{a}$ for each individual parton type have to be considered as independent free parameters in the QCD fit, although the normalisation parameters $A_i$ are constrained by the quark number and momentum sum rules, i.e. total intrinsic strangeness, charm and beauty must vanish $S=C=B=0$ and total parton momentum has to sum up to unity. Including \asz into the fit and applying mentioned constraints results in 
\begin{equation}
2 \left( \text{quarks/anti-quarks}\right)\cdot 6\left(g,u,d,s,c,b\right)\cdot 6 + 1\left(\asz\right) - n_\text{constr} > 60
\end{equation}
free parameters in the fit problem. Besides that, the contribution of different parton species can not be distinguished in NC DIS processes, e.g. apart from mass, all $u$-type quarks behave similarly in hard \ep-scattering. 
This leads to ill-defined problem and requires further assumptions about the parameter space to be introduced. 

Taking into account relations between perturbative coefficients the number of free parameters can be reduced. For example, instead of fitting individual parton distributions for each parton type, linear combinations of PDFs can be introduced.  In HERAPDF1.0~\cite{Aaron:2009aa} the following PDF components are treated independently:
\begin{align}
 xg\left(x\right) &= A_gx^{B_g}\left(1-x\right)^{C_g}, \label{eq:gpar} \\
 xu_v\left(x\right) &= A_{u_v}x^{B_{u_v}}\left(1-x\right)^{C_{u_v}}\left(1+E_{u_v}x^2\right),\\
 xd_v\left(x\right) &= A_{d_v}x^{B_{d_v}}\left(1-x\right)^{C_{d_v}},\\
 x\bar{U}\left(x\right) &= A_{\bar{U}}x^{B_{\bar{U}}}\left(1-x\right)^{C_{\bar{U}}},\\
 x\bar{D}\left(x\right) &= A_{\bar{D}}x^{B_{\bar{D}}}\left(1-x\right)^{C_{\bar{D}}}, \label{eq:Dseapar}
\end{align}
where $xg$ corresponds to the gluon, $xu\left(d\right)_v$ represent $u\left(d\right)$-valence quark distributions and $x\bar{U}\left(x\right)$ and $x\bar{D}\left(x\right)$ are $u$-type and $d$-type anti-quark distributions, respectively. At the initial scale $Q^2_0$ the anti-quark sea distributions are $x\bar{U}\left(x\right)=x\bar u$ and $x\bar{D}\left(x\right)=x\bar d+x\bar s$. Apart from parameters in Eqs.\eqref{eq:gpar}--\eqref{eq:Dseapar} all other parameters in generic parametrisation Eq.~\eqref{eq:pdfansatz} are set to zero by default\footnote{Such combination is called `central-fit`.} and released one at a time, when the sensitivity of the fit to the parametrisation ansatz is investigated. Further assumptions imposed on the fit parameters are:
\begin{itemize}
 \item $x\bar{U}$ and $x\bar{D}$ have single $B$ parameter i.e. $B_{\bar{U}}=B_{\bar{D}}$;
 \item at the initial scale the strange sea is expressed as a constant fraction of the $d$-type sea $x\bar s=f_s x \bar D$ with $f_s=0.31$~\cite{Martin:2009iq,Nadolsky:2008zw};
 \item in order to ensure $x\bar u \rightarrow x\bar d$ as $x\rightarrow 0$ additional constraint $A_{\bar U}=\left(1-f_s\right)A_{\bar D}$ is imposed;
 \item $B_{u_v}=B_{d_v}$ are assumed for the central fit, however this requirement is dropped in the study of systematic effects.
\end{itemize}
In summary, these restriction leave 10 or 11, depending on the chosen fit configuration, free parameters for the proton PDFs. The strong coupling constant \asz can be added as additional parameter. Obviously the measured jet data alone cannot constrain these parameter set. In HERAPDF1.0 the combined inclusive DIS data from \hone and \zeus were used for the proton PDFs determination. In the following section additional data set and the possible fit strategies are discussed.
