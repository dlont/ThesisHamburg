Additional sources of uncertainty on \as arise from limited precision of theoretical calculations. In this section the results of the study of sensitivity of the \asz-fits to external theoretical assumptions is presented. In general, uncertainties attributed to assumptions are difficult to quantify or even impossible to define due to their non-stochastic nature. Approaches, used for the treatment of particular error sources, are, typically, tailored for each problem and statistical interpretation of the stability of the results if often doubtful. In this section the errors due to truncation of perturbative series, limited precision of the proton PDFs and hadronisation corrections were investigated and described in detail.

\subsubsection{Uncertainties due missing higher orders}
\label{subsec:asscalevar}
Natural approach that can be used for estimation of the uncertainties attributed to theoretical assumptions is to repeat the parameter determination under different assumptions and treat the difference between the results as as uncertainty on the extracted parameter value. If the value of \asz obtained under different theoretical assumption is denoted by $\alpha_s^{\ast}$ and the central value is $\alpha_s^0$, then the uncertainty is:
\begin{equation}
 \Delta\alpha_s = \alpha_s^{\ast} - \alpha_s^0.
\end{equation}
Such an approach is called 'offset method'~\cite{amanda}. In principle, it takes into account non-linear effects in the error propagation. In case, when underlying assumption can be parametrised by a single continuous parameter, this method can be used for linear error propagation employing numerical approximation for the derivative:
\begin{equation}
 \frac{\partial \as}{ \partial a} \approx \frac{\Delta\alpha_s}{\Delta a},
\end{equation}
where $\Delta a$ is an infinitesimal change of the parameter in question.

By default, the offset method was used in this analysis for the determination of the uncertainty attributed to the truncation of the perturbation expansion for the jet cross sections. As it was described in Chapter~\ref{ch:theory}, the size of the missing terms can be estimated by varying the renormalisation and factorisation scales. For this purpose the \asz-fit were repeated using theoretical predictions evaluated with modified definition of the renormalisation and factorisation scales. Commonly accepted definition of '1$\sigma$ confidence interval' for scale variation uncertainty~\cite{soper:1997} was adopted in this work. Two variants of the scale variation were considered:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Independent variation of $\mu_R$ and $\mu_F$}. To study the stability of the fit with respect to scale variations, the theoretical predictions for the double-differential jet cross sections were recalculated with the scaled $\mu_R$ and $\mu_F$ parameters:
\begin{align}
 \mu_R \rightarrow 2\mu_R;&\qquad \mu_R \rightarrow 1/2\mu_R;\\
 \mu_F \rightarrow 2\mu_F;&\qquad \mu_F \rightarrow 1/2\mu_F;
\end{align}
performing each variation one at a time. In general, the fits were characterised by larger value of $\chi^2/N_\text{DF}$. Only the fit with $\mu_F \rightarrow 2\mu_F$ had smaller value of $\chi^2/N_\text{DF}$ than the central \asz-fit. The resulting variation of \asz was:
\begin{equation}
 \asz = 0.1218\;^{+0.0057}_{-0.0050}\left(\mu_R\right)\;^{+0.0003}_{-0.0003}\left(\mu_F\right)
\end{equation}
\item \textbf{Simultaneous variation of $\mu_R$ and $\mu_F$}. Because the analytic expressions for the renormalisation and factorisation scales are related
\begin{equation}
 \mu_F = \lim_{\etjetb \rightarrow 0} \mu_R,
\end{equation}
it is natural to vary both scales up and down simultaneously. The obtained variations are:
\begin{equation}
 \asz = 0.1218\;^{+0.0065}_{-0.0053}\left(\text{scales}\right)
\end{equation}
Such fit variants resulted in more conservative estimate of the uncertainty when compared to the combined error obtained from independent variations. 
\end{itemize}
It can be seen that the fits are much more sensitive to the renormalisation scale variation and result in asymmetric uncertainty on \asz value. The comparison of the fit results for different scale variations is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:asthunc_dd} and denoted as $\delta_1$.

Other other approaches for the treatment of the scale variation uncertainty were also investigated. As an alternative, theoretical uncertainties were included into the covariance matrix assuming that errors attributed to the scale variations are completely uncorrelated across the measurements points. In this case the total error attributed to the theoretical and experimental uncertainties was propagated to the uncertainty on \asz value using the Hesse-method. In order to determine the effect of the theoretical component, the uncertainty from the scale variations was calculated from the total $\Delta_\text{tot}\as$ error according to:
\begin{equation}
 \Delta_\text{scales}\as = \sqrt{\left(\Delta_\text{tot}\as\right)^2 - \left(\Delta_\text{exp}\as\right)^2}
\end{equation}
Apart from that, another approach was tested. The uncertainties due to missing higher-orders contribution were included into the $\chi^2$ using the nuisance parameters, similar to jet-energy scale or luminosity uncertainty. In this case the systematic shifts attributed to the theoretical uncertainty are treated as correlated across different bins and propagated to the result using the Hesse-method. Overall, fits with Hesse-treatment of the scale variation uncertainties resulted in substantial reduction of \asz error, when compared to the offset method. The comparison of different approaches is provided in Table~\ref{tab:scaleuncvariants}.
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
 \hline
 Treatment approach & $\Delta\as$ \\
 \hline
 \hline
  Offset & $\phantom{x}^{+0.0065}_{-0.0053}$\\

  Hesse (uncorrelated) & 0.0015 \\

\end{tabular}
\caption{Comparison of the uncertainty on extracted \asz-value due to missing higher orders obtained using different error treatment approaches. The uncertainties due to renormalisation and factorisation scale variations are combined in a single contribution.}
\label{tab:scaleuncvariants}
\end{table}

The reduction of the \asz-value uncertainty can be explained as follows. If one interpreters the simultaneous least-squares fit to all measured points of the double-differential cross sections as the averaging procedure for the \asz values from individual measurements, then the offset method would correspond to the averaging of \asz-values determined with the scaled definition for the renormalisation and factorisation parameters and assuming equal weight for every extraction. On the other hand, in Hesse-approach, the extractions characterised by smaller theoretical uncertainty acquire larger weight in the averaging procedure and therefore the uncertainty of the average \asz is smaller. Although, theoretically, nuisance-parameters and covariance matrix approaches must be equivalent, the results from the former method are difficult to interpret. In this case, the numerical value for the systematic shift represents the rescaling factor that has to be applied to the renormalisation or factorisation parameters in order to obtain better fit:
\begin{equation}
 b_{\mu} = \ln{\frac{\mu'}{\mu^0}},
\end{equation}
where $\mu^{0}$ is the numerical value for the default choice of $\mu_{R(F)}$, while $\mu'$ represents the 'optimal' value obtained from the fit. Because $\mu_{R(F)}$ can be arbitrary in QCD there are no preferred values apriory. Moreover, the nuisance treatment of the scale variation uncertainty assumes full correlation of the missing higher-orders contributions across the phase space, which is difficult to justify.

The fits with alternative definitions of the renormalisation and factorisation scales were also performed. Scale choices such as $\mu_R=\etjetb$, $\mu_R=Q$ and $\mu_F=\etjetb$, $\mu_F=\sqrt{\qsq+\etjetb^2}$ were investigated. In general, alternative fits had comparable $\chi^2/N_\text{DF}$, but resulted in lower value of \asz. Only the fit with $\mu_R=\mu_F=\sqrt{\qsq+\etjetb^2}$ gave rise to somewhat larger value on the strong coupling. The discrepancy between the results of different fit variants was smaller than the scale variation uncertainty estimated using the offset-method and therefore is assumed to be covered by the scales variation uncertainty.

\subsubsection{Sensitivity to the pPDF sets}
\label{subsec:aspdfassump}
Because the proton PDFs have limited precision the stability of the \asz-fits with respect to PDF assumption has to be investigated. Several effects contributing to the proton PDF uncertainty can be identified. All of them can be roughly attributed to one of the following categories:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Limited PDFs precision due data uncertainty.} Because PDFs are extracted in QCD-fits to data, the uncertainty on the measurements propagates to the error on the proton PDFs, which in turn affects the precision of the \asz determination.
 \item \textbf{QCD-fit setup differences.} As it was explained above, simultaneous PDF-fit of all individual parton species is an ill-defined problem and additional assumptions has to be imposed in order to obtain reasonable fit results. However, the choice of the data and fit settings is usually ambiguous. Different fitting groups, typically, use partially different datasets to constrain PDF parameters. Furthermore, they can have different choices of PDF parametertrisation at the starting evolution scale, distinct approaches to the treatment of heavy quarks, alternative $\chi^2$-function and/or error definitions, etc. This leads to different results for PDFs obtained by different groups.
 \item \textbf{PDF and \asz correlation.} In the most of the high-energy processes the strong coupling and the proton PDFs are coupled, i.e. the predictions are proportional to the product $\propto \as\cdot f_i\left(x,\mu\right)$. In particular, the gluon component is always accompanied by \as in the matrix elements, therefore, a value of \asz has to be assumed in a PDF-fit, which introduces an implicit dependence of the results on the \asz. In order to enable propagation of this type of uncertainty into pQCD predictions, different PDF fitting groups, provide series of PDFs, extracted assuming different values of \asz.
\end{itemize}

% \subsubsection{PDF uncertainty propagation}
In the HERAPDF1.5 set, that was used as a default in the calculations of the inclusive-jet cross sections, 34 systematic variations were performed for estimation of the PDF uncertainty and were classified into three groups roughly corresponding to the categories listed above. 

The uncertainty due to the experimental precision of the data is propagated to the PDF parameters and is represented in the covariance matrix form. In order to simplify propagation of the uncertainties attributed to the proton PDFs, the matrix is transformed to diagonal form with eigenvectors representing the uncertainty on the corresponding linear combinations of the PDF parameters. $1\sigma$ parameter variation along the eigenvectors translates into the 68\% confidence interval for the pQCD predictions according to the formula~\cite{Campbell:2006wx}
\begin{equation}
 \delta^{\pm}\mathbf{t} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N_{eig}}{\left(\mbox{$\delta_i^{\pm}\mathbf{t}$}\right)^2}},
 \label{eq:mastereq}
\end{equation}
where the positive (negative) uncertainty, $\delta^{\pm}\mathbf{t}$, is calculated from the quadratic sum of positive (negative) variations of the predictions with respect to those based on central PDF, $\mbox{$\delta_i^{\pm}\mathbf{t}$}^2$. The summation runs over eigenvectors, number of which is equal to the number of free PDF parameters\footnote{In total, the HERAPDF1.5 set provides 20 up and down eigenvector variations.}. When propagated to the strong coupling, PDF eigenvectors variation results in asymetric uncertainty on the \as value. In order to obtain a symmetric estimate of the \as-error $\delta\as$ was defined as:
\begin{equation}
 \delta\as = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N_{eig}}{\frac{\left(\mbox{$\delta_i^{+}\as$} - \mbox{$\delta_i^{-}\as$}\right)^2}{2}}}.
 \label{eq:mastereqsym}
\end{equation}
It provides a reasonable average of the asymmetric uncertainties and can be considered as a modification of the offset method. In order to estimate the uncertainty on \asz, the \as-fits were repeated for every individual up and down variations of the PDF eigenvectors and compared to the central value~\ref{eq:asdoubledifval}. The results of these fits are summarised in Figure~\ref{fig:asthunc_dd} and denoted by $\delta_2$.
\begin{landscape}

\end{landscape}

The model uncertainty on the PDF, attributed to the variation of the assumptions such as fraction of the strange quarks in the $d$-type sea PDFs, mass of the charm and bottom quarks, etc. was also treated using the offset approach. The detailed description of the nature of individual variations are presented in~\cite{herapdf1.5}. The uncertainty on \asz was estimated  by taking the difference between the variation and the central value, and then adding in quadrature all positive (negative) differences to obtain the positive (negative) model error (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:mastereq}). Corresponding results of the \as-fits are combined into $\delta_3$ group in Figure~\ref{fig:asthunc_dd}. 

Variations of the functional form of the PDF parameterisation (see~\cite{herapdf1.5}) were treated using the offset-method as well. To form the parametrisation envelope, the largest positive (negative) difference between the variation and the central value is taken as the positive (negative) parametrisation error and added in quadrature to the model errors. The outcome of the variations are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:asthunc_dd} as $\delta_4$.

The uncertainty attributed to the assumption imposed on the magnitude of the strong coupling in the PDF extraction procedure was estimated from two PDF sets with \asz=0.1156 and \asz=0.1196. The difference between the two results, (see Figure\ref{fig:asthunc_dd}~($\delta_5$)), was scaled to the current uncertainty on the world average~\cite{Bethke:2012jm}.

In order to obtain the total error on the \asz-value due to the proton PDF, all mentioned sources were combined quadratically which resulted in the final value:
\begin{equation}
 \asz = 0.1218\;^{+0.0029}_{-0.0018}\left(\text{PDF}\right)
\end{equation}

The \asz-fits with alternative predictions based on PDF sets provided by different fitting-groups were repeated in order to investigate the stability of the \asz determination procedure. The considered set of PDFs comprises the extractions by the MSTW~\cite{}, NNPDF~\cite{} and CT~\cite{} groups. The obtained results were compared to the reference fit based on HERAPDF1.5, described above. All fits were performed using the so-called 'central' PDF set determined with the \asz value recommended in the corresponding PDF-fit. Analysing the obtained results, several observations can be made:
\begin{itemize}
 \item All fits with alternative PDFs have larger $\chi^2$ than the reference one, however in all cases the obtained values of $\chi^2/n_\text{DF}$ were $\lesssim 1$. Figure~\ref{fig:chi2scanpdf} illustrates the scan of the $\chi^2$ as a function of \asz for different PDF sets. The difference in the fit quality was attributed to the difference in the gluon distribution of different PDF sets, especially in the high-$x$ region, relevant for inclusive-jet production (see Figure~\ref{fig:pdf_gluon_comp}).

\end{figure}
 \item It is interesting to note that in the HERAPDF1.5 PDF-fit only inclusive NC and CC DIS data from HERA were used, while, for example, MSTW08 already includes HERAI inclusive-jet data. The preference of the HERAPDF set in the fit was unexplained and we believe that the 'true' PDF is somewhere between the considered sets.
 \item The obtained values of the strong coupling were larger than that extracted using HERAPDF1.5, but the difference was always within the uncertainty attributed to the HERAPDF1.5 parameterisation. A summary of the fit results based on different PDF sets are compiled in Table~\ref{tab:asdifferentPDFs}
\begin{table}[t]
 \begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
 \hline
 PDF set & \asz-value & $\chi^2/n_\text{DF}$\\
 \hline
 \hline
 HERAPDF1.5 & $0.1218^{+0.0029}_{-0.0018}$ & 0.626 \\
 NNPDF23 & 0.1221 & 1.00\\

\end{itemize}

In accord with PDF4LHC recomendations, in recent analysis~\ref{Britzger} an additional uncertainty was attributed to the difference between results obtained with different PDF sets. In contrast to that, the checks, described above, reveal the consistency of the considered PDF sets in the phase space of the inclusive-jet measurement and support the adequacy of the HERAPDF1.5 error analysis. Therefore no additional uncertainties due to PDFs were assinged to the \asz-value determined in this thesis. 

\subsubsection{Sensitivity to the \asz Assumption}
\label{subsec:asassump}
As it was mentioned, the strong coupling enters pQCD predictions for hadron-induced processes through the matrix elements and the DGLAP spliting functions $\mathcal{P}\left(z\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{N}{\as^i\cdot P_i\left(z\right)}$ (see chapter~\ref{ch:theory}). Threfore, in order to determine PDFs in global fits to the data, a value of \asz has to be either taken from other analyses or fitted together with PDFs. Due to the coupled nature of perturbative hard coefficients and PDFs ($c\left(\as\right)\cdot f\left(x,\mu\right)$) the decrease of one quantity leads to the incerase of the other to maintain constant cross section. Therefore the question of the influence of the \asz assumtion in the PDF extraction procedure has to be addressed. The Figure~\ref{fig:aschi2scanpdf} shows the results of the \asz-fits to the double-differential inclusive-jet cross secions with PDF sets from several fitting groups, extracted under different assumtions on the magnitude of the strong coupling. It can be seen that, apart from MSTW08 sets, avaliable for a wide range of assumed \asz values, the extracted \asz increases with increasing \asz-value assumed in the PDFs. Only for MSTW08 and NNPDF23 input and output values of \asz coinside at relatively large value of \as. Qualitatively, correlation of the input and output values can be explained as follows: in the global fit PDFs decrease as assumed value of the strong coupling incereases, therefore to compensate the reduction of $f\left(x,\mu\right)$ in the fit to inclusive-jet data, the determined \asz-value increases.

As can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:aschi2scanpdf1} the quality of the fit deteriorates with increasing assumed value of the strong coupling and the fits based on PDFs with the smallest \asz-value yeild the smallest values of $\chi^2/n_\text{DF}$. Nevertheless, for MSTW08, CT10 and HERAPDF1.5 the dependece of $\chi^2/n_\text{DF}$ on the assumed value is very mild in the vicinity of minimum. The resulting values of \as for the fits with minimal value of $\chi^2/n_\text{DF}$ are consistent with the central value within the experimental uncertainty.
