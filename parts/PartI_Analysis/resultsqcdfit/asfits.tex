As a first step \asz is determined in a fit to individual measurements of single-differential inclusive-jet cross section as a function of $\etjetb$. Because single parameter is extracted from exactly one point the minimum of the $\chi^2$-function is attained when $\chi^2=0$. The systematic shifts, represented by nuisance paramters, cannot be determined in this case. Thus, the only constraint, imposed by the penalty terms, ensures vanishing of the systematic shifts. The extracted values of \asz are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:alphassinglediffindividual}. Overall, all \as-values have comparable experimental uncertainty. However, the \as-value determined from the highest-\etjetb point is characterised by somewhat smaller experimental precision which is due to larger statistical uncertainty of the data in this region of phase space. In general, \as-values from individual measurements are in very good agreement withing the experimental uncertainties, which indicates the overall consistency of all mesurements.

The combined \asz-value determined from a simultaneous fit to all measured data point is
\begin{equation}
 \asz = 0.1195 \pm 0.0029 \left( \text{exp.} \right) %^{+0.0079}_{-0.0061} \left( \text{scales} \right) ^{+0.0028}_{-0.0010} \left( \text{pdf}\right)
 \label{eq:assingledifval}
\end{equation}
and is also demonstrated in the Figure~\ref{fig:alphassinglediffindividual}. The quality of combined fit is characterised by $\chi^2/N_\text{DF}=1.79/5$ which is below 1 and may indicate an overestimation of the experimental uncertainties.

The determined values are compared to the result of simultaneous fit to all data points in the measured \etjetb range (pink line and green band). The error bars for individual points indicate the size of the total experimental uncertainty, while the green band represents that for the simultaneous fit.}

Besides \asz extraction, the energy-scale dependence of the strong coupling was investigated. The \as-values were determined in the QCD fit to measured \dsdetjetb. The predictions for individual \dsdetjetb data points were parametrised in terms of $\as\left(\left<\etjetb\right>\right)$ instead of \asz (see Eq.~\eqref{eq:fitnloqcdpredictions}), where $\left<\etjetb\right>$ is the average \etjetb of the data in particular cross section bin. For this determination the theoretical settings were modified in order to minimise sensitivity of the extraction procedure to assumed running of the strong coupling. By default, the calculations were performed for the renormalisation scale choice $\mu_R=\sqrt{\qsq+\etjetb}$. Therefore, to avoid running from $\mu=\left<\etjetb\right>$ to $\mu=\mu_R=\sqrt{\qsq+\etjetb}$ the renormalisation scale was set to $\mu_R=\etjetb$. Nevertheless, the residual dependece on RGE assumption indirectly persits in pPDF evolution, because the factrosisation scale was chosen to be $\mu_F=Q$ and the evolution between two scales $\mu_R = \etjetb \longrightarrow \mu_F = Q$ has to be performed. In Figure~\ref{fig:asrunning} the extracted values of \as are compared to the renormalisation-group equation QCD predictions determined with two-loop precision~\cite{Gross:1973id, Politzer:1973fx, Gross:1973ju, Politzer:1974fr}. Although, the described \as-extraction procedure cannot be treated as an independent test of the coupling running, it illustrates the consitency of the \as determination approach.

The data demonstrate the running of the strong coupling over a large range of \etjetb.
