The \herafitter program is a tool originally developed for least-square fits of the proton PDFs. Nowadays, it is an efficient code for QCD analysis of high-energy collider data. In this analysis the \herafitter~\cite{Aaron:2009aa,Aaron:2009kv} program package was used for \as extraction as well as for simultaneous \as+ PDF fits.

The minimisation of the $\chi^2$-function is performed employing the iterative \migrad algorithm from the \minuit package~\cite{James:1975dr}. The minimisation procedure requires repeated recalculation of the $\chi^2$-function. Hence, the NLO pQCD predictions for the jet observables, when included in the fit, have to be calculated repeatedly in each iteration of the QCD-fit. However, evaluation of the predictions for the jet production in an iterative procedure using the techniques described in Section~\ref{sec:nlojet} has two main limitations: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item due to stochastic nature of the Monte Carlo approach for calculation of the phase space integrals, the $\chi^2$ minimisation procedure,  in general, may not converge;
 \item the computing time for a single iteration (i.e. evaluation of the $\chi^2$ function for a single fit parameter value) is prohibitively long.
\end{itemize}
Therefore, in the iterative fit procedure the \fastnlo framework for the recalculations of the NLO predictions for the jet production have been used. A brief summary of the \fastnlo approach is provided in the next section. 

\textcolor{blue}{The uncertainties due to experimental precision of the data are propagated to the determined parameters by means of ``Hesse''-method implemented in \minuit. The other details concerning the $\chi^2$-function definition can be found in the \herafitter manual~\cite{herafitter:2014:manual}.}
