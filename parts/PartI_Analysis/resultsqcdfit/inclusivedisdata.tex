The inclusive DIS double-differential reduced cross sections $\mathrm{d}\tilde\sigma^2/\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}\qsq$ measured at \hera constitute the backbone of all modern proton parton density extractions~\cite{Lai:2010vv,Martin:2009iq,Alekhin:2012ig,Ball:2011uy,Aaron:2009aa}. The combined dataset~\cite{Aaron:2009aa} used in all mentioned analyses comprises measurements of inclusive NC and CC DIS cross sections by the \hone and \zeus collaborations. The summary of the data samples is provided in~\cite{Aaron:2009aa}. The phase space of the combined NC DIS cross sections is $6\cdot 10^{-7} \le x \le 0.065$ and $0.045 \le \qsq \le 30000$ \GeV$^2$ for values of inelasticity in range $0.005 \le y \le 0.95$. The kinematic range of the CC DIS data is $1.3\cdot 10^{-2} \le x \le 0.40$ and $300 \le \qsq \le 30000$ \GeV$^2$ and $y$ in region $0.037 \le y \le 0.76$. It is important to note that the jet measurements provided in this work are based on statistically independent data sample.

In practice, datasets for different reactions have different sensitivity to various PDF components. For example, NC and CC DIS cross sections are very sensitive to the quark content of the proton, because at leading order\footnote{The basic argument holds for higher order corrections as well.} in DIS the coupling of exchanged boson is proportional to the electroweak charge of the quarks. In contrast to quarks, gluons, do not interact directly with $\gamma,\zn$ or $W^{\pm}$ but via $g\rightarrow q\bar q$ process with one of the quarks coupling to electroweak boson. Therefore, in the predictions of for inclusive \ep scattering, the gluon density is always accompanied by the \as, which results in a strong correlation between the strong coupling and the gluon parton density in QCD fits to inclusive DIS data. A simple approximation~\cite{Prytz:1993vr} for the scaling violation of the structure function $F_2\left(x,\qsq \right)$ illustrates this property:
\begin{equation}
 \frac{\partial F_2\left(x,\qsq \right)}{\partial \ln \qsq} \approx \sum_i^{n_f}e_{q_i}^2 \frac{\as}{\pi} xg\left(2x\right) \int_0^1 \mathcal{P}_{qg}\left(z\right)\mathrm{d}z, 
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{P}_{qg}\left(z\right)$ is the $g\rightarrow q\bar q$ splitting function. An independent source of information constraining the magnitude of the strong coupling or the gluon density is necessary for unbiased determination of both quantities. It was demonstrated in earlier studies~\cite{Chekanov:2005nn,H1prelim-11-143,ZEUS-prel-11-010}, that including jet data into the fit mitigates the problem of large correlation between \as and $xg\left(x\right)$ and significantly improves the precision of simultaneous $xg\left(x\right)$ and \as extraction. Figure~\ref{fig:pdfcontributions} shows Feynman diagrams for different powers of the strong coupling constant illustrating interaction of exchanged boson with various parton types.

For example, the gluon density $xg\left(x\right)$ provides the dominant contribution to the NC DIS $\ep$-scattering cross section at low and medium $\x$ at high-$\qsq$, although it appears for the first time at NLO, while jet production in the Breit-frame is sensitive to $xg\left(x\right)$ already at leading order. The sum over all quark and anti-quark densities weighted with respective electric charges $x\Delta\left(x\right)=x\sum_{a}{e_a^2\left(q_a\left(x\right)+\bar{q}\left(x\right)\right)}$ is the second dominant contribution to inclusive DIS and jet processes and appears in all orders of perturbation theory.

In summary, it can be seen that, in principle, using the linear combinations of PDFs, the number of free parameters in the fitting problem can be reduced significantly. Furthermore, one can consider the proton parton distributions to be fixed by former determinations and try to extract only one parameter \asz from the data. Depending on the combination of the datasets used and the number of free parameters assumed in the fit, several options have been considered in this thesis and are outlined in the next section.
