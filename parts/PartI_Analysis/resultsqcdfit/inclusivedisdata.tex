The inclusive DIS double-differential reduced cross sections $\mathrm{d}\tilde\sigma^2/\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}\qsq$ measured at \hera constitute the backbone of all modern proton parton density extractions~\cite{Lai:2010vv,Martin:2009iq,Alekhin:2012ig,Ball:2011uy,Aaron:2009aa}. The combined dataset~\cite{Aaron:2009aa} used in all mentioned analyses comprises measurements of inclusive NC and CC DIS cross sections by the \hone and \zeus collaborations. The summary of the data samples is provided in~\cite{Aaron:2009aa}. In general, the phase space of the combined NC DIS cross sections is $6\cdot 10^{-7} \le x \le 0.065$ and $0.045 \le \qsq \le 30000 \GeV^2$ for values of inelasticity in range $0.005 \le y \le 0.95$. The kinematic range of the CC DIS data is $1.3\cdot 10^{-2} \le x \le 0.40$ and $300 \le \qsq \le 30000 \GeV^2$ and $y$ in region $0.037 \le y \le 0.76$.

In practice, different dataset provide different sensitivity to various PDF components. For example, NC and CC DIS cross sections are very sensitive to the quark content of the proton, because at leading order\footnote{The basic argument holds for higher order corrections as well.} in DIS the coupling of exchanged boson is prortional to the electroweak charge of the quarks. In contrast to quarks, gluons, do not interact directly with the $\gamma,\zn$ or $W^{\pm}$ but via $g\rightarrow q\bar q$ process with one of the quarks coupling to electroweak boson. Therefore, in the predictions of for inclusive \ep scattering, the gluon density is always acompanied by the \as, which results in a strong correlation between the strong coupling and the gluon parton density in QCD fits to inclusive DIS data. A simple approximation~\cite{Prytz:1993vr} for the scaling violation of the structure function $F_2\left(x,\qsq \right)$ illustrates this property:
\begin{equation}
 \frac{\partial F_2\left(x,\qsq \right)}{\partial \ln \qsq} \approx \sum_i^{n_f}e_{q_i}^2 \frac{\as}{\pi} xg\left(2x\right) \int_0^1 \mathcal{P}_{qg}\left(z\right)\mathrm{d}z, 
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{P}_{qg}\left(z\right)$ is the $g\rightarrow q\bar q$ splitting function. An independent source of information constraining the magnitude of the strong coupling or the gluon density is necessary for unbiased determination of both quantities. It was demonstrated in earlier studies~\cite{Chekanov:2005nn,H1prelim-11-143,ZEUS-prel-11-010}, that including jet data into the fit mitigates the problem of large correlation between \as and $xg\left(x\right)$ and significantly improves the presicion of simultaneous $g\left(x\right)$ and \as extraction.

It is important to note that the jet measurements provided in this work are based on statistically independent data sample.
