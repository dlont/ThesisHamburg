The schematic layout of the \zeus detector is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:zeus2d1}. A right-handed Cartesian coordinate system with the origin at the nominal interaction point was adopted in \zeus. The incoming proton momentum vector defines the positive Z direction. It was also called the ``forward'' direction. The positive direction of the X-axis pointed towards the centre of the \hera ring, while the positive Y-axis pointed upwards. The azimuthal angle, $\phi$, was defined in the transverse X--Y plane, while the polar angle was measured with respect to the +Z axis.

The pseudorapidity was an important quantity used in this analysis and defined by the following expression:
\begin{equation}
\eta = -\ln \tan \dfrac{\theta}{2}.
\end{equation}
The pseudorapidity has simple transformation properties under Lorentz boosts. The difference $\Delta \eta$ is a Lorentz invariant. For massless particles the numerical value of the pseudorapidity coincides with the normal rapidity.
