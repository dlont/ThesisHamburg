The schematic layout of the ZEUS detector is presentd in Figure~\ref{fig:zeus2d1}. A right-handed Cartesian coordinate system with the origin at the nominal interaction point was adopted in ZEUS. The incoming proton momentum vector defines the positive Z direction. It was also called ``forward'' direction. The positive direction of the X-axis was pointing towards the centre of the HERA ring, while the positive Y-axis was pointing upwards. The azimuthal angle, $\phi$, was defined in the transverse X--Y plane, while the polar angle was measured with respect to the +Z axis.

The pseudorapidity was an important quantity used in this analysis and defined by the following expression:
\begin{equation}
\eta = -\ln \tan \dfrac{\theta}{2}.
\end{equation}
The pseudorapidity has simple transformation properties under Lorentz boost. The difference $\Delta \eta$ is a Lorentz-invariant. The numerical value of pseudorapidity coincides with normal rapidity for massless particles.
