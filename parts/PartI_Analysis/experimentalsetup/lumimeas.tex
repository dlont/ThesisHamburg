The $\ep$-brems-strahlung process~\cite{Bethe:1934za}
\begin{equation}
	e + p \rightarrow e' + \gamma + p
\end{equation}
was used to determine the instantaneous luminosity at \zeus. The large cross section of this process allows rapid accumulation of large event samples in a relatively short time. Furthermore, the theoretical predictions for the rate of this reaction have a precision of better than $0.5\%$. The detection of the photon or the electron emerging from the interaction was used as an experimental signature of this process. The schematic layout of the luminosity monitor is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lumi_monitor_layout}.

The photons from the reaction are emitted at small angles $\theta \lesssim 0.5$ mrad and leave the beam-pipe through a thin window located at $92.5$ m from the interaction point. Approximately $9\%$ of the photons were converted into $e^+e^-$ pairs in the window. Electrons and positrons were deflected by a dipole magnet into the luminosity spectrometer (SPEC)~\cite{physics-0512153}, which was installed at 104 m distance downstream. The remaining photons were detected in the photon calorimeter (PCAL) ~\cite{desy-92-066,zfp:c63:391,acpp:b32:2025} located at 107 m.

The instantaneous luminosity was determined from the formula:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \frac{R_{\ep\rightarrow \ep\gamma}}{ \sigma_{\ep\rightarrow \ep\gamma}}.
\end{equation}
The background from the interaction of electrons with residual beam gas was estimated using electron pilot bunches and subtracted in the calculations.

The information from SPEC was not available for all runs, while the PCAL functioned continuously, so the luminosity value determined using the PCAL was used on a run-by-run basis. The systematic uncertainty on the measurement obtained with SPEC was lower than that for PCAL. It amounts to $1.8\%$ and was used as the resulting precision of the luminosity value.
