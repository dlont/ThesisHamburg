Two polarimeters were used for the determination of the electron beam polarisation. In order to reduce the systematic uncertainty on the polarisation value, the longitudinal and transverse polarisations were measured independently by LPOL~\cite{nim:a479:334} and TPOL~\cite{nim:a329:79} detectors, respectively. The dependency of the Compton cross section on the orientation of the electron spin was utilised. In both cases a laser system was used as a source of incident photons.

Circularly polarised continuous green argon-ion laser light was used for the measurement of the transverse polarisation.The photons from the laser beam collided with the transversely polarised electrons. The scattered photons were detected in a dedicated calorimeter. The asymmetry of the photon-scattering-angle distribution was used to determine the polarisation value.

A similar measurement was performed with longitudinally polarised electrons. A Nd:YAG laser pulse was transported to the collision region, where circularly polarised photons backscatter from the electron beam. Switching the circular polarisation of the photon beam from left-handed to right-handed, the asymmetry in the total energy of the scattered photon was determined and the electron beam polarisation value was derived.
