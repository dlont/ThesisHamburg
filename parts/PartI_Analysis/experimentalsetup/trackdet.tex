The main parts of the tracking system of the \zeus detector were the silicon microvertex detector (MVD) and the central tracking detector (CTD). These tracking detectors were used for the measurements of momenta and positions of charged particles as well as for the identification of the interaction and secondary decay vertices.

\subsubsection{Microvertex Detector}
\label{subsubsec:mvd}
The MVD~\cite{nim:a581:656} was a silicon-strip detector located in the vicinity of the beam-pipe for achieving an excellent resolution for secondary vertex tagging. It was installed during the 2000--2001 shut-down before the \hera II running period. The microvertex detector was divided into a forward (FMVD) and barrel (BMVD) parts (see Figure~\ref{fig:MVD_artistic}). In the barrel part, the silicon sensors were arranged in ladder structures grouped in two to three cylindrical layers surrounding the beam-pipe. In the forward direction, the sensors were assembled into four circular discs (wheels) oriented perpendicularly to the beam direction. Large number of read-out channels and high resolution allowed reliable separation of tracks emerging from hadronic jets. The main MVD characteristics are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:mvdgeomparameters}.

\subsubsection{Central Tracking Detector}
\label{subsubsec:ctd}
The CTD~\cite{nim:a283:477,nim:a279:290,npps:b32:181} was a multi-wire cylindrical drift chamber used for the determination of charged-particle positions and momenta. The operation principle of CTD was based on detection of the ionisation of a gas mixture by the charged particles traversing the volume of CTD. The transverse momentum of the particle was determined from the curvature of the track in the solenoid magnetic field (see below). The dependence of energy losses within the volume of CTD on particle velocity was used to identify the particle type.

	\label{fig:ctd}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:ctd} shows one octant of the CTD. The wires were organised in nine superlayers (SL). Using different orientation of wires with respect to the CTD axis in odd and even superlayers made it possible to also accurately determine the Z position of the hit. The inclination angle in even superlayers was about $\pm 5\%$, while it was 0 in odd superlayers. For fast determination of the Z coordinate at the trigger level, the Z-by-timing technique was used. Specialised electronics to detect the distance along the Z-axis from the difference in the arrival time of pulses at each end of the wire was installed in SL3 and 5. The precision achieved in the Z position was about 3 \cm.

Both CTD and MVD operated in a $1.43$~Tesla magnetic field parallel to the Z-axis and produced by a thin superconducting solenoid surrounding the drift chamber. For CTD-MVD tracks that pass through all nine CTD superlayers, the momentum resolution was $\sigma(p_{T})/p_{T} = 0.0029 p_{T} \oplus 0.0081 \oplus
0.0012/p_{T}$, with $p_{T}$ in \GeV. Other parameters characterising the CTD are collected in Table~\ref{tab:ctdgeomparameters}.
