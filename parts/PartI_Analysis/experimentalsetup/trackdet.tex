The main parts of the tracking system of the \zeus detector were of the silicon microvertex detector (MVD) and the central-tracking detector (CTD). These tracking detectors were used for the measurements of momenta and positions of charged particles as well as for the identification of the interaction and secondary decay vertices.

\subsubsection{Microvertex Detector}
\label{subsubsec:mvd}
The MVD was a silicon-strip detector located in the vicinity of the beam-pipe for achieving an excellent resolution for secondary vertex tagging. It was installed during the 2000--2001 shut-down before the HERAII running period. The microvertex detector was divided in forward (FMVD), barrel (BMVD) parts (see Figure~\ref{fig:MVD_artistic}). In the barrel part the silicon sensors were arranged in ladder structures grouped in three cylindrical layers surrounding the beam-pipe. In the forward direction the sensors were assembled into four circular discs (wheels) oriented perpendicularly to the beam direction. Large number of read-out channels and high hit resolution allowed reliable separation of tracks emerging from hadronic jets. The main MVD characteristics are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:mvdgeomparameters}.

\subsubsection{Central Tracking Detector}
\label{subsubsec:ctd}
The CTD was a multi-wire cylindrical drift chamber used for the determination of charged particle positions and momenta. The operation principle of CTD was based on detection of the ionisation of a gas mixture by the charged particles traversing the volume of CTD. The transverse momentum of the particle was determined from the curvature of the track in the solenoid magnetic field (see below). The dependence of energy losses within the volume of CTD on particle mass was used for identification of the particle type.

	\label{fig:ctd}
\end{figure}
In Figure~\ref{fig:ctd} one CTD octant is demonstrated. The wires were organised in nine superlayers (SL). Using different orientation of wires with respect to the CTD axis in odd and even superlayers made it possible to accurately determine the Z position of the hit. The inclination angle in even superlayers was about $\pm 5\%$. For fast determination of the Z coordinate at the trigger level the Z-by-timing technique was used. For this purpose 8 sense wires were installed in each of the SL3 and SL5. The precision of the determination of the Z position, achieved by this method, was about 3 \cm.

Both CTD and MVD operated in a $1.43$~Tesla magnetic field parallel to the Z-axis and produced by a thin superconducting solenoid surrounding the drfit chamber. For CTD-MVD tracks that pass through all nine CTD superlayers, the momentum resolution was $\sigma(p_{T})/p_{T} = 0.0029 p_{T} \oplus 0.0081 \oplus
0.0012/p_{T}$, with $p_{T}$ in \GeV. Other parameters characterising the CTD are collected in Table~\ref{tab:ctdgeomparameters}.
