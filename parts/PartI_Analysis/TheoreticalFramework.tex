All microscopic phenomena observed up to date can be described in the framework of the Standard Model (SM). The SM is a renormalisable quantum field theory of the strong, electromagnetic and weak interactions. According to the SM the matter particles are represented by spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Dirac fermions coming in three generations while interaction between matter fields is mediated by spin-1 gauge bosons. The SM is based on combined local $\mathrm{SU}\left(3\right) \bigotimes \mathrm{SU}\left(2\right) \bigotimes \mathrm{U}\left(1\right)$ symmetry representing strong, weak and electromagnetic sectors, respectively. The fermions are distinguished by the quantum numbers corresponding to the gauge groups. Quark fields are endowed with electroweak and colour charges, while leptons (electron $e$, muon $\mu$, tau $\tau$ and three corresponding neutrinos $\nu_e, \nu_\mu, \nu_\tau$) carry only electroweak charge. As a consequence of exact local gauge symmetry the mediators of the strong force, gluons, are massless quanta. In contrast to the strong interaction three electroweak gauge bosons $W^\pm, Z^0$ acquire mass as a result of spontaneous $\mathrm{SU}\left(2\right) \bigotimes \mathrm{U}\left(1\right)$ symmetry breaking, while photon $\gamma$ stays massless. According to the Higgs mechanism elementary particles acquire mass due to coupling to the scalar field, quanta of which have been recently discovered at the LHC~\cite{higgs atlas cms}.

Subsequent sections briefly outline the theoretical framework used for the description of the strong sector of the Standard Model and hard interactions at HERA in particular.
