The energy of hadronic jet reconstructed from energy deposits in the calorimeter is influenced by various effects e.g. particle absorbtion in un-instrumented material between the production point and the calorimeter, inhomogeneities of the detector, noise etc. Hadron jets loose typically 5-15\% of their energy in inactive medium (superconducting solenoid, support structures etc.) in front of the calorimeter. The energy loss depends on the depth of the traversed dead material and varies along z-direction and with the crossing angle.
