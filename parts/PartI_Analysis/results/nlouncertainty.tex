In order to test perturbative QCD predictions it is important to check the stability of the predictions with respect to variations of input parameters, such as the value of \as, proton PDF, renormalisations and factorisation scales etc. In this analysis, an uncertainty was attributed to each individual variation of theoretical parameters. The following sources of uncertainty were investigated:
\begin{itemize}
 \item the uncertainty on the predicted inclusive-jet cross section due to the value of \asz was estimated by repeating the calculations assuming different values\footnote{These values correspond to the standard deviation of \as, that was determined in the \herapdf fit~\cite{upub:herapdf1.5}} of \asz=0.1156 and 0.1196 and using the corresponding proton PDF sets from the \herapdf1.5 series. The resulting uncertainty was typically about $\pm2\%$;
 \item the uncertainty on the NLO QCD calculations arising from higher-order terms, estimated by varying the renormalisation scale up and down by a factor of 2. It was about $\pm10\%$ in the low-\qsq, low-\etjetb region but decreasing to about $\pm5\%$ at high \qsq and high \etjetb;
 \item the uncertainty of the calculations originating from the dependence on factorisation scale was estimated by repeating the calculations with $\mu_F$ scaled up and down by factors 0.5 and 2, resulting in a difference between the predictions $\lesssim\pm 3\%$;
 \item the uncertainty due to the modelling of the parton shower was estimated as the symmetric relative difference between the predictions for hadronisation correction factors obtained using \lepto or \ariadne MC
\begin{equation}
\delta^{\pm}_{\text{PS},i} = \frac{1}{2}\max{\left(\left|\mathcal{C}^\text{hadr}_{\lepto,i} - \mathcal{C}^\text{hadr}_{av,i}\right|,\left|\mathcal{C}^\text{hadr}_{\ariadne,i} - \mathcal{C}^\text{hadr}_{av,i}\right|\right)},
\label{eq:hadrcorunc}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{C}^\text{hadr}_{av,i} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\mathcal{C}^\text{hadr}_{\lepto,i}+\mathcal{C}^\text{hadr}_{\ariadne,i}\right).\notag
\end{equation}
 It was found to be typically about $\pm 1\%$ in most of the phase space.
\item the statistical uncertainty of the theoretical calculations was $<1\%$ and therefore was neglected.
\item the theoretical uncertainty due to the proton PDF was estimated according to the \herapdf1.5 recommendation~\cite{upub:herapdf1.5}. The error was subdivided into two independent components: PDF eigenvectors variations, model and para\-metrisation variations (see Chapter~\ref{ch:resultsqcdfit} for detailed discussion). The detailed breakdown of PDF uncertainty for individual double-differen\-tial cross-section bins is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:pdfunc}. Overall, the uncertainty amounts to about $\lesssim 5\%$ for \qsq < 5000 $\GeV^2$ and $\lesssim 3\%$ in the high-\qsq region. Thus, the PDF uncertainty is the second-largest contribution to the total theoretical uncertainty. It was observed that the dominant contribution to the PDF error was due to assumptions in the PDF parametrisation\footnote{The predictions with the largest deviation from the central value were characterised by specific PDF parametrisation in which parameters $E_{u_{v}}$ and $D_{u_{v}}$ were let to be free parameters in the PDF fit. See Section~\ref{subsec:qcdfitparams} for more details.}.
\end{itemize}
The total theoretical uncertainty was calculated by summing the individual contributions in quadrature. The break-down of the theoretical uncertainties as functions of \etjetb and \qsq is summarised in Figure~\ref{fig:thunc}.
