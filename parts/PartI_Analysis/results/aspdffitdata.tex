For the determination of the strong coupling constant the \dsdetjetb~cross sections measured in different regions of \qsq~were used. The statistical correlations between cross section bins were taken into account in the covariance matrix of the data. The systematic experimental uncertainties were treated differently depending on the nature of the systematic source. The details concerning the approach used for the systematic uncertainties treatment is provided in ...
