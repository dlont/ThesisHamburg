As it was mentioned, perturbative approach based on DGLAP equations predicts only $\qsq$ evolution of the PDFs, while $x$ dependence has to be determined by other means. In principle, nonperturbative data, like parton momentum distribution at some initial scale $\mu_0$, can be determined using lattice QCD approach. However, at the moment the precision of theoretical predictions for the proton PDFs are not competitive to the results of global QCD analyses of experimental data. An extensive discussion of lattice results is provided in~\cite{HÂ¨agler Hadron structure from lattice quantum chromodynamics}.

There are two main approaches
