In perturbative QCD the predictions for a physical observable, $f$, is calculated order-by-order as a power series in small coupling $\alpha_s \equiv \dfrac{g_s^2}{4\pi} \ll 1$
\begin{equation}
   f=f_{0}\alpha^{k}_s + f_{1}\alpha^{k+1}_s + f_{2}\alpha^{k+2}_s + \ldots
	 \label{eq:pertseries}
\end{equation}
The perturbation series starts at some power of the expansion parameter and only few terms of the series are usually calculated. The expansion coefficients $f_i$ in the above series are usually calculated by summing up Feynman diagrams (or similar techniques). Number of diagrams grows as $\sim i!$ with increasing perturbative order, therefore such series is, in general, divergent and has to be treated as an asymptotic expansion~\cite{lipatovQCD}. However, it is commonly assumed that few first terms in the series provide a reasonable approximation to exact solution.

Calculation of higher order corrections requires consideration of more complex fields configurations which emerge due to quantum fluctuations. Such configurations can be formally divided in two classes according to the topology of the corresponding Feyman diagrams. An example of next-to-leading order diagrams contributing to the jet production in deep inelastic scattering process are demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:nlojetfeyn}. The real corrections (Figure~\ref{fig:nlojetfeyn}a) are characterised by increased number of legs with respect to lower order graph, while in virtual contributions (Figure~\ref{fig:nlojetfeyn}b) the fields form closed loops.

Intuitively, with decreasing the spatial scale at which the process is considered, one has to take into account more fluctuations of quantum fields. As a result, the field couplings or masses has to be interpreted as effective parameters of the theory, that take into account charge screening, self interaction etc. Nevertheless, it is unnatural that the fluctuations occurring at scales much smaller than that corresponding to typical energy scale of the process in question, should have a significant influence. Remarkably, QCD admits redefinition of the coupling, fields and masses that incorporates contributions from fields fluctuations occurring in the limit of infinite energy. Such a property of QCD is called renormalisability and is a specific feature of the gauge theories.
