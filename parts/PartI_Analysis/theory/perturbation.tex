In perturbative QCD, the predictions for a physical observable, $f$, are calculated order-by-order as a power series in small coupling $\alpha_s \equiv \dfrac{g_s^2}{4\pi} \ll 1$
\begin{equation}
   f=f_{0}\alpha^{k}_s + f_{1}\alpha^{k+1}_s + f_{2}\alpha^{k+2}_s + \ldots
	 \label{eq:pertseries}
\end{equation}
The perturbation series starts at some power of the expansion parameter and only a few terms of the series are usually calculated. The expansion coefficients $f_i$ in the above series are usually calculated by summing up Feynman diagrams (or similar techniques). The number of diagrams grows as $\sim i!$ with increasing perturbative order, therefore such series are, in general, divergent and have to be treated as an asymptotic expansion~\cite{Ioffe:2010zz}. However, it is commonly assumed that the few first terms in the series provide a reasonable approximation to the exact solution.

Calculation of higher-order corrections requires consideration of complex field configurations which emerge due to quantum fluctuations. Such configurations can be formally divided into two classes according to the topology of the corresponding Feyman diagrams. An example of next-to-leading-order diagrams contributing to the jet production in deep inelastic scattering process are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:nlojetfeyn}. The real corrections (Figure~\ref{fig:nlojetfeyn}a) are characterised by increased number of legs with respect to lower-order graphs, while in virtual contributions (Figure~\ref{fig:nlojetfeyn}b) the fields form closed loops. Leading-order graphs always have a tree structure.

Intuitively, as the spatial scale at which the process is considered decreases,  more fluctuations of the quantum fields must be taken into account. As a result, the field couplings or masses have to be interpreted as effective parameters of the theory, which take into account charge screening, self interaction etc. Nevertheless, it is unnatural that fluctuations occurring at scales much smaller than that corresponding to the typical energy scale of the process in question should have a significant influence. Remarkably, QCD admits redefinition of the couplings, fields and masses that incorporate contributions from fields fluctuations occurring in the limit of infinite energy. Such a property of QCD is called renormalisability.
