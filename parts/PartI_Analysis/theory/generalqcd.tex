Quantum Chromodynamcs emerged as a model for description of hadron spectra and absence of observations of free hadron constituents. The QCD Lagrangian density can by derived from local $\mathrm{SU}\left(3\right)$ invariance and reads as follows
\begin{align}
 \mathcal{L}\left( x\right)_{\mathrm{QCD}}  = & -\dfrac{1}{4}G_a^{\mu\nu}G_{\mu\nu}^a + i\sum_{j=1}^n{\overline{\psi}^{\alpha}_j \gamma_\mu \left( D^\mu \right)_{\alpha\beta} \psi_j^\beta } - \sum_{j=1}^n{m_j\overline{\psi}^{\alpha}_j\psi_{j,\alpha}} \\
					      & - \dfrac{1}{2\alpha_G} \partial^\mu \mathcal{A}^a_\mu \partial_\mu \mathcal{A}_a^\mu - \partial_\mu \overline{\varphi}_a D^\mu \varphi^a,
\end{align}
where $G_{\mu\nu}^a \equiv \partial_\mu \mathcal{A}^a_\nu - \partial_\nu \mathcal{A}^a_\mu + gf_{abc}\mathcal{A}^b_\mu \mathcal{A}^c_\nu $, $a=1 \ldots 8$ are the Yang-Mills field strenght tensor~\cite{C.N. Yang and R.L. Mills, Phys. Rev. 96 (1954) 191.} constructed from gluon fields $\mathcal{A}^a_\mu$ in adjoint representation of $\mathrm{SU}\left(3\right)$. Quarks of different flavours are described by $\psi_j$ fields in fundamental representation of $\mathrm{SU}\left(3\right)$ while $\varphi^a$ are eight anti-commuting scalar Faddeev-Popov ghost fields required in quantisation procedure~\cite{L.D. Faddeev and Y.N Popov, Phys. Lett. B 25 (1967) 29;
B. De Wit, Phys. Rev. Lett. 12 (1964) 742.}. Covariant derivative, $\left( D^\mu \right)_{\alpha\beta} = \delta_{\alpha\beta}\partial_\mu - ig\sum_a{\dfrac{1}{2}\lambda^a_{\alpha\beta}\mathcal{A}^a_\mu}$, defines infinitesimal transformation in colour space acting on quark fields. Gell-Mann $3\times 3$ matrices, $\lambda^a_{\alpha\beta}$, are the generators of $su\left(3\right)$ algebra and $f_{abc}$ are its real structure constants related by the following expression:
\begin{align}
 \left[T_a,T_b\right] = if_{abc}T_c,\qquad T_a = \dfrac{1}{2}\lambda_a.
\end{align}
An important feature that can be readily observed is a non-linear term, $gf_{abc}\mathcal{A}^b_\mu \mathcal{A}^c_\nu$, in the definition of the field strength tensor. This term is the result of non-abelian structure of the symmetry group and determines the self-interaction of the force carriers. In contrast to electromagnetic interaction gluons carry two color charges. 

Given the Lagrangian density the Feynman rules for QCD can be derived.  Feynman diagrams representing interaction vertices of the fundamental fields are depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:FundamentalQCDInteractions}.

Such relatively simple model is extremely successful in description of vast variety of experimental data collected up to now. In particular, strong interaction has two distinct features: at large energy scales\footnote{In the limit $\Lambda_\mathrm{QCD}/E\rightarrow 0$, where $\Lambda^{n_f=5}_{\overline{\mathrm{MS}}}=226$ MeV is QCD characteristic energy scale.} hadron constituents behave as free particles and strength of the coupling decreases (``asymptotic freedom''); conversely, at low energy scales strength of the coupling grows, bounding quarks and gluons inside hadrons (``confinement'').  
 
At current stage direct solution of Yang-Mills equations is an incapable task. Almost all quantitative QCD predictions are based on three first-principle approaches: perturbative QCD (pQCD), lattice QCD and effective theories. Perturbative approach exploits smallness of the strong coupling constant in high-energy regime and develops successive approximations to the solution. Next section summarises basic information about pQCD approach.
