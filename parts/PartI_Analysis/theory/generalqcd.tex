Quantum Chromodynamcs emerged as a model to describe hadron spectra and the absence of observations of free hadron constituents. The QCD Lagrangian density can be derived from local $\mathrm{SU}\left(3\right)_{C}$ invariance and reads as follows
\begin{align}
 \mathcal{L}\left( x\right)_{\mathrm{QCD}}  = & -\dfrac{1}{4}G_a^{\mu\nu}G_{\mu\nu}^a + i\sum_{j=1}^n{\overline{\psi}^{\alpha}_j \gamma_\mu \left( D^\mu \right)_{\alpha\beta} \psi_j^\beta } - \sum_{j=1}^n{m_j\overline{\psi}^{\alpha}_j\psi_{j,\alpha}} \notag\\
					      & - \dfrac{1}{2\alpha_G} \partial^\mu \mathcal{A}^a_\mu \partial_\mu \mathcal{A}_a^\mu - \partial_\mu \overline{\varphi}_a D^\mu \varphi^a,
								\label{eq:qcdlagrangian}
\end{align}
where 
\begin{equation}
G_{\mu\nu}^a \equiv \partial_\mu \mathcal{A}^a_\nu - \partial_\nu \mathcal{A}^a_\mu + g_sf_{abc}\mathcal{A}^b_\mu \mathcal{A}^c_\nu , \qquad a=1 \ldots 8
\label{eq:gluonstrenghtensor}
\end{equation}
are the Yang-Mills field-strength tensor~\cite{Yang:1954ek} constructed from gluon fields $\mathcal{A}^a_\mu$ in the adjoint representation of $\mathrm{SU}\left(3\right)_C$; $g_s$ denotes the QCD coupling parameter\footnote{Similarly to electric charge, $e$, in Quantum Electrodynamics, the parameter $g_s$ corresponds to the colour charge.} and the value of $\alpha_G$ defines the gauge. Quarks of different flavours are described by $\psi_j$ fields in the fundamental representation of $\mathrm{SU}\left(3\right)_C$ while $\varphi^a$ are eight anti-commuting scalar Faddeev-Popov ghost fields required in the quantisation procedure~\cite{Faddeev:1967fc, DeWitt:1964yg}. The covariant derivative, $\left( D^\mu \right)_{\alpha\beta} = \delta_{\alpha\beta}\partial_\mu - ig_s\sum_a{\dfrac{1}{2}\lambda^a_{\alpha\beta}\mathcal{A}^a_\mu}$, is a generator of infinitesimal transformations in colour space acting on quark fields. Gell-Mann $3\times 3$ matrices, $\lambda^a_{\alpha\beta}$, are the generators of the $\mathrm{SU}\left(3\right)_C$ algebra and $f_{abc}$ are its real structure constants, defined by:
\begin{align}
 \left[T_a,T_b\right] = if_{abc}T_c,\qquad T_a = \dfrac{1}{2}\lambda_a.
\end{align}
An important feature that can be immediately observed is a non-linear term, $g_sf_{abc}\mathcal{A}^b_\mu \mathcal{A}^c_\nu$, in the definition of the field-strength tensor (Eq.~\eqref{eq:gluonstrenghtensor}). This term is the result of the non-Abelian structure of the symmetry group and determines the self-interaction of the force carriers. In contrast to the electromagnetic interaction, gluons carry two color charges. Given the Lagrangian density, the Feynman rules and diagrams for QCD can be derived.  Feynman graphs representing interaction vertices of the fundamental fields of QCD are depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:FundamentalQCDInteractions}.

A theory with such an economical structure is extremely successful describing the vast variety of experimental data collected up to now. In particular, the strong interaction has two distinct features: at large energy scales,\footnote{In the limit $\Lambda_\mathrm{QCD}/E\rightarrow 0$, where $\Lambda\approx 225$ MeV is QCD characteristic energy scale.} hadron constituents behave as free particles and the strength of the coupling decreases (``asymptotic freedom''); conversely, at low energy scales, the strength of the coupling grows, binding quarks and gluons inside hadrons (``confinement'').  
 
Direct solution of the Yang-Mills equations is an impossible task. Almost all quantitative QCD predictions are based on three first-principle approaches: perturbative QCD (pQCD), lattice QCD and effective theories. The perturbative approach exploits the smallness of the strong coupling constant in the high-energy regime and develops successive approximations to the solution. The next section summarises basic information about the pQCD approach.
