The phase-space slicing method is based on separating the $(n+1)$-parton phase-space into regions with $(n+1)$ or only $n$ partons resolved. The invariant mass, $s_{ij}$, of the pair of partons can be used to identify such regions. If the invariant mass is above the threshold, $s_\text{min}$, two partons are considered as resolved. In the resolved region the matrix elements are regular and integration can be carried out numerically. In the unresolved regions the singular matrix elements can be approximated and integrated analytically. The soft and collinear poles arising from the integration are cancelled against the poles from the virtual corrections.
