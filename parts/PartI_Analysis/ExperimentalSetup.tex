\chapter{Experimental Setup}
\label{ch:expsetup}
The data for this analysis were collected by the ZEUS detector, which was a general-purpose $4\pi$-detector, designed for the measurement of the dynamics of $\ep$ interactions. The ZEUS detecror consisted of the tracking system, the calorimeter system and muon chambers; the decision to store the data for the further offline analysis was taken by the three-level trigger system. In this chapter the main characteristics of the detector components, relevant for this analysis, are briefly described. A detailed description of the detector can be found in~\cite{zeus:1993:bluebook}.
