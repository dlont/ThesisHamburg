This chapter introduces the most important features of the  experimental setup that was utilised in this thesis. At the beginning the relevant properties of the accelerator complex is briefly introduced. Later the relevant components of the \zeus detector are discussed.

\section{The \zeus Detector}
\label{subsec:zeusdet}
The data for this analysis were collected by the \zeus detector, which was a general-purpose $4\pi$-detector, designed for the measurement of the dynamics of $\ep$ interactions. The \zeus detector consisted of the tracking system, the calorimeter system and muon chambers; the decision to store the data for further off-line analysis was taken by the three-level trigger system. In this section the main characteristics of the detector components relevant for this analysis are briefly described. A detailed description of the detector can be found in~\cite{zeus:1993:bluebook}.
