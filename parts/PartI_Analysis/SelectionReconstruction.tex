\chapter{Event Selection and Reconstruction}
Offline reconstruction of event kinematics, electron candidates and hadronic final state is introduced in this chapter. Criteria for the offline selection of high-$\qsq$ inclusive jet events are described. 

Trigger-level event selection cannot fulfil signal to background discrimination requirements because of limited processing time and significant complexity of the reconstruction algorithms for the objects such as secondary vertices, particle decays or jets. Event samples selected using only trigger requirements are characterised by significant false-positive rate. In addition, information about detector operating conditions such as amount of dead channels, changes in high-voltage, CTD gas pressure, temperature, etc. are difficult or impossible to account at the trigger level. Therefore, in addition to data-quality and trigger requirements an offline event selection is applied to the data.
