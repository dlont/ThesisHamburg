\section{QCD Analysis of Inclusive-Jet data}
\label{sec:aspdffit}
This chapter summarises the results of the determination of the strong coupling constant at various scales from the measured inclusive-jet cross sections as well as combined determination of the proton PDFs and \asz from inclusive DIS and the measured inclusive-jet data. At the beginning the theoretical framework of the analysis is outlined. After the least-square method and the notion of the 'QCD fit' are explained the results of the \asz determination from single-differential and double-differential inclusive-jet cross sections are presented. Then, the investigatigation of the impact of experimental and theoretical uncertainties on the extracted \asz values is described and the influence of the proton PDFs set assumtption is emphasised. The chapter proceeds with the discussion of simultaneous \as+PDF fit to the measured and inclusive DIS data from \hera and concludes with a test of runnning of the strong coupling.
