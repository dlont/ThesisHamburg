The theoretical predictions for the measured cross sections obtained using the NLOJET++ program include only the leading order QED contribution, while the measurements were influenced by the higher-order processes like running of the electromagnetic coupling, initial-state and final-state EM radiation etc. To maintain the consistency between the data and theoretical predictions the measured cross sections were corrected to the Born level using the MC predictions. A multiplicative factor applied to the data was determined using two \lepto MC samples with higher-order QED processes switched on and off. The correction factor is equal the the ratio of the corresponding jet cross sections:
\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{C}^\text{QED}_i = \frac{\sigma_i^\text{BORN}}{\sigma_i^\text{QED}}.
 \label{eq:eqdcorr}
\end{equation}

Figures~\ref{fig:qedcorr}~\subref{fig:z0corr_subfig1}--\subref{fig:z0corr_subfig3} illustrate the determined QED corrections in different kinematic bins. In general, the correction
