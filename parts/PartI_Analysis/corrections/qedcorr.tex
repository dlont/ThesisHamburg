The theoretical predictions for the measured cross sections obtained using the \nlojet program include only the leading order QED contribution, while the measurements were influenced by the higher-order processes like running of the electromagnetic coupling, initial- and final-state EM radiation etc. To maintain the consistency between the data and theoretical predictions the measured cross sections were corrected to the Born level using the MC predictions. A multiplicative factor applied to the data was determined using two \lepto MC samples with higher-order QED processes switched on and off. The corresponding jet cross sections are denoted by $\sigma^\text{QED}$ and $\sigma^\text{BORN}$, respectively. The correction factor is equal to the ratio:
\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{C}^\text{QED}_i = \frac{\sigma_i^\text{BORN}}{\sigma_i^\text{QED}}.
 \label{eq:eqdcorr}
\end{equation}

Figure~\ref{fig:qedcorr} illustrates the determined QED corrections in different kinematic bins. In general, the correction is approximately independent of \etjetb and increases with increasing \qsq. It is about 3\% in the lowest \qsq range and reaches about 10\% for $5000 < \qsq < 20000\;\GeV^2$.
