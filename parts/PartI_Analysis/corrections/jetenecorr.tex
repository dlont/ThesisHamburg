The energy of hadronic jets reconstructed from energy deposits in the calorimeter is influenced by various effects e.g. particle absorption in uninstrumented material between the production point and the calorimeter, inhomogeneities of the detector, noise etc. Hadron jets loose typically 5-15\% of their energy in inactive media (superconducting solenoid, support structures etc.) in front of the calorimeter. This effect may lead to the systematic migrations of jets to cross section bins with lower energy. In principle, such effects must be taken into account in the unfolding procedure. Nevertheless, in order to minimise jet migrations and avoid possible bias from the energy loss in inactive detector media, a dedicated jet-energy correction was employed in this analysis.

Two common approaches for correcting the jet energy loss exist:
\begin{itemize}
 \item the \emph{bottom-up} approach consists of correcting the energy of the input objects (i.e. calorimeter cells in this analysis) to compensate for the energy loss and then using the corrected objects as an input to the jet algorithm;
 \item in the \textcolor{blue}{\emph{top-bottom}} approach the energy of identified jets is corrected directly.
\end{itemize}
In general, the two approaches are equivalent if the unfolding of the measured cross sections is performed. In this thesis, the \textcolor{blue}{top-bottom} approach was adopted.

Monte Carlo simulations were used to estimate the energy loss because they provide the detailed information about hadron propagation in the detector volume. The measured jet energy, $E_T^{jet,det}$, depends approximately linearly on the 'true', $E_T^{jet}$, value, but the size of the energy loss depends on the thickness of the traversed material and therefore on the jet pseudorapidity in the laboratory frame. For this reason, the complete $-1<\etajetlab<2.5$ measurement region was divided into 14 equal regions and the correction was determined separately in each $\etajetlab$ bin.

The procedure proceeds as follows:
\begin{itemize}
 \item in the MC events accepted at the generated and reconstructed levels, a pair of jets was identified according to the distance between jets in the $\eta-\phi$ plane. A hadron-level jet was matched to the reconstructed jet if the distance $r=\sqrt{\left[\left(\eta_{had}-\eta_{det}\right)^2 + \left(\phi_{had}-\phi_{det}\right)^2\right]}$ between the two was small, $r<0.7$, and no further jets were reconstructed within the cone. In order to avoid any bias on the correction procedure introduced by the boundaries of the jet phase space, the cuts on the jet transverse energy were relaxed to $\etjetbhad>6\,\GeV$ and $\etjetbdet>3\,\GeV$ at the hadron and detector levels, respectively;
 \item in each bin $i$ of $\etajetlab$, a linear fit $\left\langle\etjetbdet\right\rangle = a_i + b_i\cdot\left\langle\etjetbhad\right\rangle$ was performed, where $\left\langle\etjetbdet\right\rangle$ and $\left\langle\etjetbhad\right\rangle$ were determined using the matched jet sample;
 \item the corrections were determined using the \ariadne and \lepto sample for each data taking period separately. 
\end{itemize}
The fits are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:05e_lepto_coeffitients}.

Given the extracted fit parameters, the components of the jet four-momentum were scaled such that the following relation was obtained:
 \begin{equation}
  E_{T,B}^{jet,det} \mapsto E_{T,B}^{jet,corr} = \frac{E_{T,B}^{jet,det} - a_i}{b_i}.
 \end{equation}
Because the analysis in this thesis was performed in the Breit frame, the jet pseudorapidity in the laboratory frame was recalculated and the corresponding correction factors were applied. Assuming a valid description of the detector effects in the simulations, the correction was applied to both the data and MC jets, thus introducing a dependence on the parton-shower simulation. \textcolor{blue}{Therefore in the unfolding procedure the respective data and MC samples were utilised.} In the MC simulations the correction was applied in addition to that introduced in Section~\ref{sec:jetcalib}.
