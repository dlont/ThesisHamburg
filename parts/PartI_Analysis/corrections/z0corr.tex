As mentioned earlier, the fixed-order pQCD predictions from the \nlojet include only the single-photon exchange component. However the contribution from $\gamma Z$-interference and $Z^0$-exchange become significant in the kinematic region of boson virtualities $\qsq > 1000\, \GeV^{2}$. The \lepto generator was utilised for the estimation of the size of these effects. The ratio of the jet production cross sections calculated including and excluding electroweak effects was used for the correction:
\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{C}^\text{$Z^0$}_i = \frac{\sigma_i^\text{$Z^0$}}{\sigma_i^\text{no $Z^0$}}.
 \label{eq:z0corr}
\end{equation}
However, the $\gamma\znought$-interference depends on the charge of the lepton beam, thus the luminosity-weighted average of the correction factors for the $e^+p$ and $e^-p$ scattering was applied to the pQCD predictions.

The correction factors are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:z0corr}. The size of the correction is approximately independent of jet transverse energy and reaches about 20\% in the largest \qsq bin.
