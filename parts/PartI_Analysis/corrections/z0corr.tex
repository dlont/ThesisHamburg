As it was mentioned, the fixed order pQCD predictions from the NLOJET++ include only the single-photon exchange component. However the contribution from $\gamma Z$-interference and $Z^0$-exchange become significant in the kinematic region of the measurementes for the processes with the virtuality above $M_{Z^0}$. Therefore the stand-alone \lepto exacutable was utilised for the estimation of the size of these effects. The ratio of the jet production cross sections calculated including and excuding electroweak effects was used for correction
\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{C}^\text{$Z^0$}_i = \frac{\sigma_i^\text{$Z^0$}}{\sigma_i^\text{no $Z^0$}}.
 \label{eq:z0corr}
\end{equation}
However, the cross sections predictions depend on the leton beam, thus the luminosity weighted average of the correction factors for the $e^+p$ and $e^-p$ scattering was applied to the pQCD predictions.

The correction factors are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:z0corr}~\subref{fig:z0corr_subfig1}--\subref{fig:z0corr_subfig3}. Overall ...
