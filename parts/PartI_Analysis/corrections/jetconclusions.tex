Obtaining an accurate description of jet observables is a necessary prerequisite for the measurement of the jet cross sections. In order to improve the description of the jet distributions in MC simulations, three types of corrections were implemented. The described methods include the reweighting of the jet spectrum (Section~\ref{sec:q2etrew}), correction of the hadronic energy-scale difference in data and MC (Section~\ref{subsec:jetenescale}) and correction of the jet transverse energy for the looses in inactive detector material (Section~\ref{subsec:jetenecor}). As a result, the description of the jet quantities was significantly improved when compared to original distributions. The comparison of resulting distributions in data and MC are show in Figures~\ref{fig:cp_arijets},~\ref{fig:cp_leptojets}. In addition, after implementing all jet corrections, the correlation between generated and reconstructed jet quantities was checked. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:h_EtHadEtDetCorrel_05e_correlplot}, the reconstructed value of \etjetb provides an unbiased estimator of the truth-level quantity in the complete range of jet transverse energies. The same conclusion can be made about jet angular variables (see Figures~\ref{fig:h_EtaHadEtDetCorrel_05e_correlplot},~\ref{fig:h_PhiHadEtDetCorrel_05e_correlplot}), although a slight bias for \etajetb was observed in the region $\etajetb < 0.5$. This was attributed to the fact that at the generator level the origin of the \zeus coordinate system was used instead of the position of the primary vertex for the determination of \etajetb.

After the correcting the difference between in hadronic energy scale in data and simulations, the energy-scale uncertainty for the calibrated jet sample amounted to $\pm 1\%$ for jets with $\etjetb > 10\;\GeV$  and $\pm 3\%$ for jets with $3 < \etjetb < 10\;\GeV$. The effect of this uncertainty on the measured jet cross sections will be discussed in Section~\ref{subsec:systunc}.

Given that an accurate description of the measured distributions in MC has been demonstrated in this chapter, a reliable estimation of detector effects such as trigger and/or reconstruction inefficiencies, migrations etc. can be performed and will be described in Chapters~\ref{ch:unfolding} and~\ref{ch:resultscs}.
