The detection and reconstruction of the scattered electron depend on the longitudinal position of the primary vertex, $Z_\text{vtx}$. In particular the detector and trigger acceptances vary with $Z_\text{vtx}$. The shape of the distribution of the primary vertex position is determined by the length\footnote{The space-charge distribution within a bunch typically has a Gaussian shape.} of the interacting bunches and thus depends on machine conditions. In order to suppress non-$ep$ background, restrictions were applied on the primary vertex position. Therefore, since the luminosity measurements refer to the whole $ep$ interaction region, the cuts on $Z_\text{vtx}$ have an effect on the overall normalisation. 

Summarising, an accurate simulation of the $Z_\text{vtx}$ distribution in the MC samples is very important. The $Z_\text{vtx}$-reweighting procedure adopted here was developed in~\cite{thesis:behr:2010} and consisted of the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
 \item in order to avoid a possible bias from the jet selection as well as from tracking restrictions at the trigger level, the FLT30 bit was required instead of the FLT40, 43, 50 bits that were used as a standard in the analysis;
 \item selection cuts on the longitudinal position of the interaction vertex were removed;
 \item the $Z_\text{vtx}$ distributions distributions in the data and MC were fitted to the sum of four Gaussian functions, $f\left(\vec a\right)=\sum_{i=1}^4{a_N^{\left(i\right)}\exp{\left[-\left(Z_\text{vtx}-a_{\mu}^{\left(i\right)}\right)^2/\left(a_\sigma^{\left(i\right)}\right)^2\right]}}$. The reweighting factors, $w_{Z}$, were determined from the fit of the ratio of the normalised data and MC distributions to the function $w=f\left(\vec a_{\mathrm{Data}}\right)/f\left(\vec a_{\mathrm{MC}}\right)$ using the parameters of the first fit as seed values;
 \item the weights were determined from the detector level distributions as function of the reconstructed position, $Z_\text{vtx}$. They were then applied to the MC events as a function of the true position, $Z_\text{vtx}^\text{true}$. This substitution $Z_\text{vtx} \mapsto Z_\text{vtx}^\text{true}$ can be made because the migration effects for the $Z_\text{vtx}$ distribution were found to be very small and can be neglected.
\end{itemize}

The existing MC samples for the 2004--2005~$e^-$ and 2006~$e^-$ data taking periods describe the data very well in the whole interaction region. Only for the 2006/2007~$e^+$ running period did the MC not reproduce the data distribution reasonably. Therefore, reweighting of the longitudinal position of the primary vertex was implemented only for this MC sample. The comparison between data and MC distributions for the 2006/2007~$e^+$ data taking period before and after reweighting is shown in Figures~\ref{fig:zvtxrew} and~\ref{fig:zvtxrewaf}. After reweighting a good agreement was observed.\marginpar{OB:unclear which true distribution of zvtx was generated in MC?}
