The detection and reconstruction of the scattered electron depend on the longitudinal position of the primary vertex, $Z_\text{vtx}$. In particular the detector and trigger acceptances are varying with $Z_\text{vtx}$. The shape of the primary vertex position distribution is determined by the length\footnote{The space-charge distribution within a bunch typically has a Gaussian shape.} of the interacting bunches and thus on machine and detector conditions. In order to suppress non-$ep$ background restrictions were applied on the primary vertex position. Therefore, since the luminosity measurements refer to the whole $ep$ interaction region, the cuts on $Z_\text{vtx}$ have an effect on the overall normalisation. 

Summarising, an accurate simulation of the $Z_\text{vtx}$ distribution in the MC samples is very important. The $Z_\text{vtx}$-reweighting procedure adopted here was developed in~\cite{joerg} and consisted of the following steps.
\begin{itemize}
 \item In order to avoid a possible bias from the jet selection as well as from tracking restrictions at the trigger level the FLT30 bit was required instead of FLT40, 43, 50 bits used as a standard in the analysis.
 \item Any restrictions on the longitudinal position of the interaction vertex were removed.
 \item The $Z_\text{vtx}$ distributions distributions in the data and MC were fitted to the sum of four Gaussian functions, $f\left(\vec a\right)=\sum_{i=1}^4{a_N^{\left(i\right)}\exp{\left[-\left(Z_\text{vtx}-a_{\mu}^{\left(i\right)}\right)^2/\left(a_\sigma^{\left(i\right)}\right)^2\right]}}$. The reweighting factors, $w_{Z}$, were determined from the fit of the ratio of the normalised data and MC distributions to the function $w=f\left(\vec a\right)/f\left(\vec a'\right)$ using the parameters of the first fit as seed values.
 \item The weights were determined from the detector level distributions as function of the reconstructed position, $Z_\text{vtx}$. They are then applied to the events as function of the true position, $Z_\text{vtx}^\text{true}$. This substitution $Z_\text{vtx} \mapsto Z_\text{vtx}^\text{true}$ can be made, because the migration effects for the $Z_\text{vtx}$ distribution were found to be very small and can be neglected.
\end{itemize}

The existing MC samples for the 2004--2005$e^-$ and 2006$e^-$ data taking periods describe the data very well in the whole interaction region. Only for the 2006/2007$e^+$ running period, the MC did not reproduce the data distribution reasonably. Therefore the reweighting of the longitudinal position of the primary vertex was implemented only for this MC sample. The comparison between data and MC distributions for the 2006/2007$e^+$ data taking period before and after reweighting is demonstrated in Figures~\ref{fig:zvtxrew} and~\ref{fig:zvtxrewaf}.
