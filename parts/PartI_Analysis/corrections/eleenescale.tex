The pre-processing of the data with ORANGE/ PHANTOM libraries includes dead-material and non-uniformity corrections in the electron identification algorithms. Nevertheless a residual discrepancy between data and MC simulations was observed. In order to study this discrepancy in detail the data and MC events satisfying the requirements described in Chapter~\ref{ch:selection} were used.

The resolution and electromagnetic energy scale were investigated in data and MC by taking the ratio $E_\text{SI}/E_\text{DA}$, where $E_\text{SI}$ is the measured electron energy including all corrections and $E_\text{DA}$ the energy measured by the double-angle method (see Section~\ref{subsec:da}). As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ele_enescale}~\subref{fig:ele_enescale1} the full width at half maximum of the data and \lepto distributions is about 10\%. In general, the MC simulation adequately describe the shape of the data distribution, however a systematic shift of the mean value was observed.

To investigate this shift in more details in each bin of $E_\text{DA}$ a Gaussian fit to the $E_\text{SI}/E_\text{DA}$ distribution was performed. The mean value extracted from the fit was plotted as a function of $E_\text{DA}$. The results of the fits are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ele_enescale}\subref{fig:ele_enescale_2}. It was found that the double ratio between the absolute $E_\text{SI}$ energy scales in data and Monte Carlo simulations is less than 2\%. This discrepancy was taken into account as a systematic uncertainty as described in Section~\ref{subsec:systunc}.
