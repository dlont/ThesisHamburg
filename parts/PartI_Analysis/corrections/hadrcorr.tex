In order to directly compare the NLO QCD predictions with the data, the calculations has to be corrected for hadronisation effects, because the measurements refer to jets of hadrons while the predictions relate to partons. To determine hadronisation corrections and to estimate the influence of the parton-shower modelling and hadronisation process, the predictions from \ariadne and \lepto event generators were utilised. The hadronisation correction was determined from the ratio 
\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{C}^\text{hadr}_i = \frac{\sigma_i^\text{hadr}}{\sigma_i^\text{part}}
 \label{eq:hadrcor}
\end{equation}
of the jet cross sections at the hadron, $\sigma_i^\text{hadr}$, and parton $\sigma_i^\text{part}$ levels, respectively. The parton-level cross section was determined using the partons available as an input to the hadronisation model after the parton-shower simulation step. The hadron level refers to the 'stable'\footnote{According to the \zeus convention, all particles with the lifetime $\tau > 10$ ns.} particles available in the MC event record. An average of the correction factors determined from \ariadne and \lepto was used to correct for hadronisation effects.

Figure~\ref{fig:hadrcor} illustrates the hadronisation corrections as functions of \etjetb in different regions of \qsq. Both MC generators predict similar behaviour of the correction factors. In general, the correction does not exceed 15\% and its magnitude decreases with increasing \etjetb and \qsq.
