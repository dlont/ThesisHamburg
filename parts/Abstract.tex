In this thesis the single-differential and double-differential inclusive-jet cross sections have been measured in neutral current deep inelastic \ep\, scattering for exchanged boson virtualities $\qsq>\,125\,\GeV$ and inelasticity $0.2<y<0.6$. The measurements were performed using the \zeus detector at \hera and are based on the data sample accumulated during the 2004--2007 \hera-II running period with a total integrated luminosity of 295 \invpb. Jets were identified in the Breit frame using the \kt-clustering algorithm in the longitudinally invariant inclusive mode. The cross sections refer to each jet of hadrons with transverse energy in the Breit frame $\etjetb > 8$ \GeV\, and pseudorapidity in the laboratory frame $-1<\etajetlab<2.5$. The cross sections were measured inclusively as functions of several kinematic variables and differentially in \qsq. Next-to-leading-order QCD calculations obtained using the \nlojet program describe the measurements well. The predictions based on different proton PDF sets were also compared to the measurements and the potential of the new data to constraint the proton PDFs is demonstrated. Value of the strong coupling at the scale of the mass of the \zn boson, \asz, were determined from the measured jet cross sections and the energy-scale dependence of \as was demonstrated. The obtained value is \asz=$0.1218\pm 0.0028\text{(exp.)}^{+0.0093}_{-0.0074}\text{(th.)}$
